A painless parser of java command-line arguments

Managing Java command-line arguments is a pain in the ass. I have
felt this pain in the many, many chef cookbooks I have written for
java applications. This parser does not handle all aspects of a java
program invocation. It does not find the java executable for you, nor
does it handle any argument that is space delimited.

This is currently chef-specific but I would love to see it support
Puppet as well.

I hope this helps stop some of the relentless cargo-culting of Java
command-line arguments.

This library parse JVM options so that any given option is only stored
once. It does this by breaking each option into one of the three
option categories:

1. standard, ex: -server, -enablesystemassertions
2. nonstandard, ex: -Xmx128M, -Xint
3. unstable, ex: -XX:-DisableExplicitGC, -XX:AltStack=128M
4. directive, ex: -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote

JVMArgs will ensure that only one value is stored for any given
option. Here is a quick example:

```Ruby
java_opts = JVMArgs::Args.new("-XX:-DisableExplicitGC", "-Xmx256M")
# "-XX:-DisableExplicitGC" is now stored in java_opts
java_opts.add("-XX:+DisableExplicitGC")
java_opts.add("-Xmx2G")
# the settings are now "-XX:+DisableExplicitGC" and "-Xmx2G"
java_opts.to_s
" -server -XX:+DisableExplicitGC -Xmx2G "
```

Features
--------

* Raises an error if you try to allocate a larger heap
  size than your system has available.
* Allocates 40% of available RAM for the jvm heap if "-Xmx" is not specified
* Ensures that there are no duplicate arguments. A duplicate of an
  existing entry overwrites the existing one. For example, let's say
  we add  "-Xmx128M" to the list of jvmargs but "-Xmx256M" is already
  present. "-Xmx128M" will overwrite the previous "-Xmx256M". 
* Allows the quick and easy population of certain arguments per conventions
* Inserts a space at the beginning and end of the returned string


Usage
=====

The following are all valid invocations of the constructor. You can
optionally pass a block that invokes helper methods

```Ruby

JVMArgs::Args.new("Xmx256M")
JVMArgs::Args.new("-Xmx256m") # yields the same result as previous
JVMArgs::Args.new("Xmx256M") { jmx true}
JVMArgs::Args.new("-Xint") do 
  jmx true 
  heap_size "60%" 
end

bunch_of_args = [ "-Xrs", "-DSERVER_DATA_DIR=/data/Data/", "-Xmx2560m", "-Xms2560m" ]
JVMArgs::Args.new(bunch_of_args)
```

jvmargs has several helper methods

* heap_size(percentage): set the default heap_size to a percentage of total system RAM
* jmx(boolean): set up default jmx settings

You can also add arbitrary rules that are enforced when the `to_s`
method is called. 

```Ruby
java_opts = JVMArgs::Args.new("Xmx256M")
java_opts.add_rule(:equal_max_min_heap) do |args|
  value = args[:nonstandard]['Xmx'].value
  args[:nonstandard]['Xms'] = JVMArgs::NonStandard.new("Xms#{value}")
end
```

Here is a rule to raise an error if -XX:MaxPermSize  is less than 256M

```Ruby
java_opts = JVMArgs::Args.new("Xmx256M")
# process more args here, possibly from node attributes
java_opts.add_rule(:min_permgen) do |args|
  value = args[:unstable]['MaxPermSize'].value
  value_num = JVMArgs::Utils.get_raw_num(value)
  if value_num < 256
    raise ArgumentError, "This application requires at least 256M of permgen, you supplied #{value}"
  end
end
```

Examples
========

Here is the simplest possible use. Notice that max heap size and
minimum heap size are set to the same value and jvmargs assumes that
you want to use 40% of available RAM for the heap. Note that you
_must_ call the `.to_s` method to convert the JVMArgs object to a string

```Ruby
require 'jvmargs'
java_opts = JVMArgs::Args.new
# the value of java_opts.to_s is
# " -Xmx128m -Xms128m -server "
java_command = "/usr/bin/java #{java_opts.to_s} your_app.jar start"
```

Let's ask for a specific heap size and the default JMX setup, which is
tuned for gathering metrics using the awesome collectd:GenericJMX
plugin locally.

```Ruby
require 'jvmargs'
java_opts = JVMArgs::Args.new("-Xmx512M", "-XX:MaxPermSize=256m"){ jmx  true} 
# the value of java_opts.to_s is
# " -Xmx512M -Xms512M -XX:MaxPermSize=256m -server -Djava.rmi.server.hostname=127.0.0.1 \
# -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=9000 \
# -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false "
```

After creating the initial JVMArgs object you can add additional
arguments. If the same argument already exists, it will be overwritten
by the new argument. You might do this in Chef cookbook that sets up
defaults for a java application but then takes new settings from node
attributes or in arguments to an LWRP.

```Ruby
require 'jvmargs'
java_opts = JVMArgs::Args.new("-Xmx512M", "-XX:MaxPermSize=256m")
# node['tomcat']['max_heap_size'] is "-Xmx2048M"
java_opts.store(node['tomcat']['max_heap_size'])
# the -Xmx and -Xms arguments are now "-Xmx2048M" and "-Xms2048M"
```

There are a couple friendly helper functions

```Ruby
require 'jvmargs'
java_opts = JVMArgs::Args.new("-Xmx512M", "-XX:MaxPermSize=256m"){jmx true} 
java_opts.heap_size("2048M")
java_opts.permgen("256M")
java_opts.newgen("32M")
# the -Xmx and -Xms arguments are now "-Xmx2048M" and "-Xms2048M"
# permgen is now "-XX:MaxPermSize=256M"
```
